# Backend Framework (Twisted)

## Context and Problem Statement

Graphite's backend needs to handle a large number of concurrent client connections and manage high volumes of data efficiently.

## Decision Drivers

* High concurrency support
* Efficient handling of I/O operations
* Compatibility with Python

## Considered Options

* Twisted framework
* Asyncio
* Traditional multi-threaded approach

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Twisted framework", because it is a mature and scalable event-driven architecture, which is well-suited for handling numerous concurrent connections with low overhead.

### Consequences

* Good, because efficient handling of large volumes of data and connections.
* Bad, because steeper learning curve and complexity compared to simpler approaches.

## Validation

The choice was validated through performance testing and successful handling of high volumes of data in a live e-commerce environment.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Twisted framework

* Good, because highly scalable event-driven architecture.
* Good, because efficient handling of numerous concurrent connections.
* Bad, because steeper learning curve and complexity.

### Asyncio

* Good, because part of Python's standard library.
* Good, because simpler to use compared to Twisted.
* Bad, because less mature and less feature-rich than Twisted.

### Traditional multi-threaded approach

* Good, because simpler concept and easier to understand.
* Good, because widely used and supported.
* Bad, because higher resource consumption and less efficient handling of large numbers of connections.
* Bad, because potential for concurrency-related bugs and issues.
